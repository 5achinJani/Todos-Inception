# Todos-Inception

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## A Todo App inspired from the movie [Inception](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/)

  * Plant your seeds in the dream as deep as you want.
  * Technically it's just a Todo App with Tree-view. :D 
  * You can create nested todo list in a todo and on and on.

## Future Enhanchments (In a new repo)

  * View seeds of any one dream at a time using [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
  * Manage state with [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
  * Save your world of dreams to dive in again whenever you want.
  * Use [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) instead of [Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) cause I faced performance issues with Flow:
    * Out of memory issue.
    * Type checking takes time.
    * [vscode-flow](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode) slow intellisense in [vscode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) editor.
  * Add Inception like theme to the app. (I'd love if you contribute cause I ain't good at css :D )
